# Portfolio-Optimisation-using-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), a hypothesis put forth by Harry Markowitz in his paper “Portfolio Selection,” (published in 1952 by the Journal of Finance) is an investment theory based on the idea that risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to optimize or maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk, emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher reward. It is one of the most important and influential economic theories dealing with finance and investment. We will use this methodology here for portfolio optimization of  Apple, Cisco, IBM and Amazon.
